**paused** | **bool** | Indicates that the deployment is paused. | [optional] 
**progress_deadline_seconds** | **int** | The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it is considered to be failed.

**selector** | [**IoK8sApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1LabelSelector**](IoK8sApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1LabelSelector.md) | Label selector for pods. Existing ReplicaSets whose pods are selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment. It must match the pod template&#39;s labels. | 
**strategy** | [**IoK8sApiAppsV1DeploymentStrategy**](IoK8sApiAppsV1DeploymentStrategy.md) | The deployment strategy to use to replace existing pods with new ones. | [optional]
