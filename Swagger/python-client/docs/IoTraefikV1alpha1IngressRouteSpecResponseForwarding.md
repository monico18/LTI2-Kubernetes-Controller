## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**flush_interval** | **str** | FlushInterval defines the interval, in milliseconds, in between flushes to the client while copying the response body. A negative value means to flush immediately after each write to the client. This configuration is ignored when ReverseProxy recognizes a response as a streaming response; for such responses, writes are flushed to the client immediately. Default: 100ms | [optional]
